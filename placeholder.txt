const mysql = require('mysql2/promise');
const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require('canvas'); // This might not be installed, let me check package.json

// Wait, I don't have 'canvas' installed. I'll use a simpler approach or just suggest it.
// Actually, I can do it on the server with a lightweight library or just skip for now if I don't have the deps.
// I'll check package.json again.
